# GDSC Yonsei is online!

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are community groups designed to help students develop leadership and development skills. Students participate in events hosted by Google, meet engineers on the job, and demonstrate their skills. Further, various educational materials and activities are given to support the development of their technological skills. As a member of the GDSC, students build their knowledge through peer-to-peer learning and put theory into practice through the development of solutions based on community needs.
<br />
<br />
In addition to contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and addressing climate issues, GDSC leaders are developing valuable coding skills and making a real difference. Come join us for various projects that will shape the society, and fun activities that will enrich your college experience!
